# Student-Loan-App

Created a prototype GUI student loan calculator app to let them see how modifying their repayment schedules would affect the loan cost in terms of the amount of interest that the student would pay for INFO3134 - Java class. This application was supposed to summarize our what we had learned for the course including: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and the UI/UX capabilities java has to offer. This was all done in Eclipse.
